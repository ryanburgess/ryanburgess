### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at Netflix, leading two teams that focus on Developer Infrastructure and Tools in Productivity Engineering. I'm passionate about building inclusive, high performing engineering teams.

I'm the host of the popular engineering podcast, [Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com), where a group of engineers from Netflix, Atlassian, Twitch, and Airbnb talk over drinks about careers and coding.
