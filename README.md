### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineering Manager at Netflix, leading the Developer Infrastructure and Tools team in Productivity Engineering. I'm passionate about building inclusive, high performing engineering teams.

I'm the host of the popular engineering podcast, [Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com), where a group of engineers from Netflix, Atlassian, Twitch, and Airbnb talk over drinks about careers and coding.
