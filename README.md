### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineering Manager at Netflix, leading two teams focusing on Developer Infrastructure and Tools in Productivity Engineering. I'm passionate about building inclusive, high-performing engineering teams.

I'm the host of the popular engineering podcast, [Front End Happy Hour](https://www.frontendhappyhour.com), where a group of engineers from Netflix, Atlassian, Twitch, and Airbnb talk over drinks about careers and coding.
